Rochdale is the most diverse co-op in the BSC, where people from a wide range of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds work and live together.

In the end, Rochdale is one of the most affordable places to live in Berkeley with low rent and utilities included. It’s also only a few blocks from the UC Berkeley campus.
